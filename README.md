## Background

I built this app because I enjoy visiting National Parks and I wanted to have a convinent way to look up National Park information to be able to plan my next visit.

## Use Case
This app gives people to search information on the National Parks such as the description, weather information, and directions to that park. The user is able to save the park to a bucket list and they are able to check that park off of their bucket list once they have visited.

## Initial UX

The initial mobile and desktop wireframes can be seen below:

*Add in screenshots
-Landing Page
-After user has searched that shows results
-Bucket List with park added
-Been There with Park checked off

## Working Prototype

You can access a working prototype of the app here: https://national-park-explorer.herokuapp.com/

## Functionality
The app's functionality includes:
* Search for National Park information.
* The app returns information such as park description, weather information, directions, and park website.
* Add chosen park to a Bucket List section.
* Update park to visited and save to Been There Done That section.
* Rate the park after you have visited.
* Delete parks from Bucket List and Been There Done That sections.
