# National Park Explorer
Thinkful (https://www.thinkful.com) Final Capstone Project - Full Stack app integrating with National Park Service API

*Add in screen shots

## Background

I built this app because I enjoy visiting National Parks and I wanted to have a convinent way to look up National Park information to be able to plan my next visit.

## Use Case
This app gives people to search information on the National Parks such as the description, weather information, and directions to that park. The user is able to save the park to a bucket list and they are able to check that park off of their bucket list once they have visited.

## Initial UX

The initial mobile and desktop wireframes can be seen below:

*Add in screenshots
-Landing Page
-After user has searched that shows results
-Bucket List with park added
-Been There with Park checked off

## Working Prototype

You can access a working prototype of the app here: https://national-park-explorer.herokuapp.com/

## Functionality
The app's functionality includes:
* Search for National Park information.
* The app returns information such as park description, weather information, directions, and park website.
* Add chosen park to a Bucket List section.
* Update park to visited and save to Been There Done That section.
* Rate the park after you have visited.
* Delete parks from Bucket List and Been There Done That sections.


## Technical

The app is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, and React.js. It uses AJAX JSON calls to the *NPS.gov* Open Platform API to return the national park search results. All data is held in an mLab database during the user's session. App is built to be responsive across mobile, tablet, laptop, and desktop screen resolutions.

## Development Roadmap

This is v1.0 of the app, but future enhancements are expected to include:

* Add a notes sections
* Integrate in National Monuments as well as the parks
* Add in links to hotels and campgrounds nearby parks
