## Background

I built this app because I enjoy visiting National Parks and I wanted to have a convinent way to look up National Park information to be able to plan my next visit.

## Use Case
This app gives people a way to search information on the National Parks to find a description, weather information, and directions to that park. The user is able to save the park to a bucket list and they are able to check that park off of their bucket list once they have visited.

## Working Prototype

You can access a working prototype of the app here: https://national-park-explorer.herokuapp.com/

## Functionality
The app's functionality includes:
* Search for National Park information.
* The app returns information such as park description, weather information, directions, and park website.
* Add chosen park to a Bucket List section.
* Update park to visited and save to Been There Done That section.
* Rate the park after you have visited.
* Delete parks from Bucket List and Been There Done That sections.

* Integrate in National Monuments in addition to the parks
* Add in links to hotels and campgrounds nearby parks
